      The Persian cat (Persian: گربه پارسی, romanized: Gorbe'-ye Pârsi) is a
      long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle.
      It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in English-speaking countries.
     <div> The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy
      from Persia around 1620.[1][2] Widely recognized by cat fancy since the
      late 19th century, Persian cats were first adopted by the English, and
      then mainly by American breeders after World War II.</div> Some cat fancier
      organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair
      as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development
      of a wide variety of coat colors, but has also led to the creation of
      increasingly flat-faced Persian cats. Favored by fanciers, this head
      structure can bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case
      with the Siamese breed, there have been efforts by some breeders to
      preserve the older type of cat, the traditional breed, having a more
      pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public.
      Hereditary polycystic kidney disease is prevalent in the breed, affecting
      almost half of the population in some countries.

      In 2021, Persian cats were ranked as the fourth-most popular cat breed in
      the world according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, an American
      non-profit cat registry. <sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It is not clear when long-haired cats first appeared, as there are no
      known long-haired specimens of the African wildcat, the ancestor of the
      domestic subspecies.

    <p>
      The first documented ancestors of the Persian cat were imported from
      Khorasan, Persia, into the Italian Peninsula in 1620 by Pietro della
      Valle; and from Angora (now Ankara), Ottoman Turkey, into France by
      Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc at around the same time. The Khorasan cats
      (گربه خراسانی) were grey-coated while those from Angora were white. From
      France, they soon reached Great Britain.[6] Recent genetic research
      indicates that present-day Persian cats are related not to cat breeds from
      the Near East, but to those from Western Europe., with researchers stating
      that "Even though the early Persian cat may have in fact originated from
      Persia, the modern Persian cat has lost its phylogeographical
      signature".[7]

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Persians and Angoras</strong></h3>
    <p>
      The first Persian cat was presented at the first organized cat show, in
      1871 in the Crystal Palace in London, England, organized by Harrison Weir.
      As specimens closer to the later established Persian conformation became
      the more popular types, attempts were made to differentiate it from the
      Angora.[8] The first breed standard (then called a points of excellence
      list) was issued in 1889 by cat show promoter Weir. Weir stated that the
      Persian differed from the Angora in the tail being longer, hair more full
      and coarse at the end, and head larger, with less pointed ears.[9] Not all
      cat fanciers agreed with the distinction of the two types, and in the 1903
      work, The Book of the Cat, Francis Simpson states that "the distinctions,
      apparently with hardly any difference, between Angoras and Persians are of
      so fine a nature that I must be pardoned if I ignore the class of cat
      commonly called Angora".[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Bevill Champion lays out the difference between the two types in
      the 1909 Everybody's Cat Book:[11]
    </p>
    <p>
      Our pedigree imported long-hairs of to-day are undoubtedly a cross of the
      Angora and Persian; the latter possesses a rounder head than the former,
      also the coat is of quite a different quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell goes on to detail the differences. Persian coats consist of a woolly
      under coat and a long, hairy outer coat. The coat loses all the thick
      underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the
      shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely,
      the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair,
      hanging in locks, "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts
      of the body." The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind
      legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However,
      Bell says the Angora "fails to the Persian in head," Angoras having a more
      wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a
      decided improvement to each breed, but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909
      had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Champion lamented the lack of distinction among various long-haired types
      by English fanciers, who in 1887, decided to group them under the umbrella
      term "Long-haired Cats".[11][12][unreliable source?]
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Traditional Persian</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Main article: Traditional Persian cat</em></p>

    <p>
      As many breeders in the United States, Germany, Italy, and other parts of
      the world started to interpret the Persian standard differently, they
      developed the flat-nosed "peke-face" or "ultra-type" over time, as the
      result of two genetic mutations, without changing the name of the breed
      from "Persian". Some organizations, including the Cat Fanciers'
      Association (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard
      for the Persian breed. Thus the retronym Traditional Persian was created
      to refer to the original type, which is still bred, mirroring the renaming
      of the original-style Siamese cat as the Traditional Siamese or Thai, to
      distinguish it from the long-faced modern development which has taken over
      as simply "the Siamese".

    </p>
    <h3><strong>Peke-face and ultra-typing</strong></h3>
    <p>
      In the late 1950s a spontaneous mutation in red tabby Persians gave rise
      to the "peke-faced" Persian, named after the flat-faced Pekingese dog. It
      was registered as a distinct breed in the CFA, but fell out of favor by
      the mid-1990s due to serious health issues; only 98 were registered
      between 1958 and 1995. Despite this, breeders took a liking to the look
      and started breeding towards the peke-face look. The over-accentuation of
      the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called extreme- or
      ultra-typing) produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The
      term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is
      properly used only to refer to red tabby Persians bearing the mutation.
      Many fanciers and CFA judges considered the shift in look "a contribution
      to the breed.

      While the looks of the Persian changed, the Persian Breed Council's
      standard for the Persian had remained basically the same. The Persian
      breed standard is, by its nature, somewhat open-ended and focused on a
      rounded head, large, wide-spaced round eyes with the top of the nose in
      alignment with the bottom of the eyes. The standard calls for a short,
      cobby body with short, well-boned legs, a broad chest, and a round
      appearance, everything about the ideal Persian cat being "round". It was
      not until the late 1980s that standards were changed to limit the
      development of the extreme appearance.[19] In 2004, the statement that
      muzzles should not be overly pronounced was added to the breed
      standard.[20] The standards were altered yet again in 2007, this time to
      reflect the flat face, and it now states that the forehead, nose, and chin
      should be in vertical alignment.[21]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the UK, the standard was changed by the Governing Council of the Cat
      Fancy (GCCF) in the 1990s to disqualify Persians with the "upper edge of
      the nose leather above the lower edge of the eye" from Certificates or
      First Prizes in Kitten Open Classes.[22][23]
    </p>
    <p>
      While ultra-typed cats do better in the show ring, the public seems to
      prefer the less extreme, older "doll-face" types.[15]
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>Himalayan</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Main article: Himalayan cat</em></p>
    <p>
      In 1950, the Siamese was crossed with the Persian to create a breed with
      the body type of the Persian but colorpoint pattern of the Siamese. It was
      named Himalayan, after other colorpoint animals such as the Himalayan
      rabbit. In the UK, the breed was recognized as the Colorpoint Longhair.
      The Himalayan stood as a separate breed in the US until 1984, when the CFA
      merged it with the Persian, to the objection of the breed councils of both
      breeds. Some Persian breeders were unhappy with the introduction of this
      crossbreed into their "pure" Persian lines.[24][unreliable source?][25]
    </p>
    <p>
      The CFA set up the registration for Himalayans in a way that breeders
      would be able to discern a Persian with Himalayan ancestry just by looking
      at the pedigree registration number. This was to make it easy for breeders
      who do not want Himalayan blood in their breeding lines to avoid
      individuals who, while not necessarily exhibiting the colorpoint pattern,
      may be carrying the point coloration gene recessively. Persians with
      Himalayan ancestry have registration numbers starting with 3 and are
      commonly referred to by breeders as colorpoint carriers (CPC) or
      3000-series cats, although not all will actually carry the recessive gene.
      The Siamese is also the source for the chocolate and lilac color in solid
      Persians.[26][27]
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Exotic Shorthair</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Main article: Exotic Shorthair</em></p>
    <p>
      The Persian was used as an outcross secretly by some American Shorthair
      (ASH) breeders in the late 1950s to "improve" their breed. The crossbreed
      look gained recognition in the show ring, but other breeders unhappy with
      the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would
      disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      One ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed,
      and eventually managed, to get the CFA to recognize them as a new breed in
      1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. Regular outcrossing to the Persian
      has made present-day Exotic Shorthair similar to the Persian in every way,
      including temperament and conformation, with the exception of the short
      dense coat. It has even inherited much of the Persian's health problems.
      The easier to manage coat has made some label the Exotic Shorthair "the
      lazy man's Persian". Because of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses,
      some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two
      such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being
      longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA,
      although The International Cat Association accepts them as Persians. Other
      associations register them as a separate Exotic Longhair
      breed.[28][unreliable source?]
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Toy and teacup sizes</strong></h3>
    <p>
      The generic terms are "toy" and "teacup" Persians (terms borrowed from the
      dog fancy), but the individual lines are often called "palm-sized",
      "pocket", "mini" and "pixie", due to their relatively small size.
      Currently, they are not recognized as a separate breed by major registries
      and each breeder sets their own standards for size.[29][self-published
      source] These terms are considered controversial or marketing ploys as
      cats do not have the genetic mutations that dogs possess to produce
      miniature versions of themselves as cats have a strong genetic buffering
      mechanism that keeps the genes from mutating. Unscrupulous breeders have
      resorted to harmful and repetitive inbreeding to obtain smaller cats,
      resulting in genetically weaker cats often with severe health issues and
      shortened lifespans.[30][31]
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Chinchilla Longhair and Sterling</strong></h3>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_cat#/media/File:Doll_face_silver_Persian.jpg"

        alt=""
      />
    </a>
    <p>
      In the US, there was an attempt to establish the silver Persian as a
      separate breed called the Sterling, but it was not accepted. Silver and
      golden Persians are recognized, as such, by CFA. In South Africa, the
      attempt to separate the breed was more successful; the Southern Africa Cat
      Council (SACC) registers cats with five generations of purebred Chinchilla
      as a Chinchilla Longhair. The Chinchilla Longhair has a slightly longer
      nose than the Persian, resulting in healthy breathing and less eye
      tearing. Its hair is translucent with only the tips carrying black
      pigment, a feature that gets lost when out-crossed to other colored
      Persians. Out-crossing also may result in losing nose and lip liner, which
      is a fault in the Chinchilla Longhair breed standard. One of the
      distinctions of this breed is the blue-green or green eye color only with
      kittens having blue or blue-purple eye color.[32]
